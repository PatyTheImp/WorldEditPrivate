# Code Smell 1 - Long Method

**Reviewer:** Guilherme Sim√µes

**Comments:**

- The code smell assessment correctly identifies the long method smell.
- The method is long, and it does indeed handle multiple responsibilities, which is a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
- The refactoring proposal directly addresses the issues of long method and SRP violation, promoting better code modularity and clarity.
- While the review suggests breaking the method into four parts, it would benefit from more detail on how the new methods should be designed.
