# Code Smell 1 - Long Method

**Reviewer:** Guilherme Simões

**Comments:**

- The code smell assessment correctly identifies the long method smell.
- The method is long, and it does indeed handle multiple responsibilities, which is a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
- The refactoring proposal directly addresses the issues of long method and SRP violation, promoting better code modularity and clarity.
- While the review suggests breaking the method into four parts, it would benefit from more detail on how the new methods should be designed.

# Code Smell 2 - Speculative Generality

**Reviewer:** Patrícia costa

**Comments:**

- The smell seems to be well identified since the class aparently is not being used anywhere.
- The refactoring looks appropriate.

# Code Smell 3 - Primitive Obsession

**Reviewer:** Daniel Agostinho

**Comments:**

- The smell is well identified and explained.
- The refactoring proposal is appropriate and would improve the code by encapsulating the primitive data types into a 
  new class, thus making the code more maintainable and easier to understand, which is also explained, thus making the
  refactoring proposal clear and easy to understand.
- Needs no corrections, it's fundamentally correct.
