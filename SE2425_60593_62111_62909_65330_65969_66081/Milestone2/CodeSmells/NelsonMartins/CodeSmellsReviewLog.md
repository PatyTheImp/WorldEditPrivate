# Code Smell 2 (God Class)

**Reviewer -** Patrícia Costa

**Comments:**

- The smell is well identified but the justification seems a bit lacking.
- While the number of attributes, methods, and lines of code are indicators, they alone don’t prove a class is a **God Class**.
- You should point out that the class violates the **Single Responsibility Principle** and how it violates.

# Code Smell 1 (Long Method)

**Reviewer -** Miguel Flor

**Comments:**

- The smell is well identified.
- The justification seems correct.
- The refactoring proposal is good, I can't find anything to add.
