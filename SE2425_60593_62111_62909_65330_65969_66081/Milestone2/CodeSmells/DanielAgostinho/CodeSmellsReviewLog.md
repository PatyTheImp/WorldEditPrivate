# Code Smell 3 - Feature Envy

**Reviewer -** Nuno Duarte

**Comments**
- The code smell was well identified but the explanation could have been a little more specific.
- The refactoring proposal is too generic, a little detail would have been better, for example, how the method could look or in which class it should be.

# Code Smell 2 - Long Method

**Reviewer -** Guilherme Sim√µes

**Comments -**
The Long Method code smell is well identified.
The refactoring proposal for the loadConfig method is well-thought-out and addresses the smell effectively.
By breaking down the original method into smaller, more focused methods, the proposal improves readability, maintainability, and modularity of the code.

# Code Smell 1 - Large Class

**Reviewer** Miguel Flor

**Comments**
- The Large Class code smell is well identified.
- In the explanation is properly justified why the class is considered a code smell
- The refactoring proposal is correct, maybe it could be more detailed.
