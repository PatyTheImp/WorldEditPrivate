# Code Smell 2 - Long Method

**Reviewer -** Guilherme Sim√µes

**Comments**

The refactoring proposal for the loadConfig method is well-thought-out and addresses the smell effectively.
By breaking down the original method into smaller, more focused methods, the proposal improves readability, maintainability, and modularity of the code.
