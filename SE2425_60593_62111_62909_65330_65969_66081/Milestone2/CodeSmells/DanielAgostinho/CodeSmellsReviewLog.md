# Code Smell 2 - Long Method

**Reviewer -** Guilherme Sim√µes

**Comments -**
The Long Method code smell is well identified.
The refactoring proposal for the loadConfig method is well-thought-out and addresses the smell effectively.
By breaking down the original method into smaller, more focused methods, the proposal improves readability, maintainability, and modularity of the code.
