# Code Smells 1 - Long Method

**Reviewer -** Daniel Agostinho

**Comments -**
- Although the explanation is short it gets the point across without missing any key details, the reader can easily
  understand the problem and the implications of the code smell.
- The refactoring proposal is a tad bit too simplistic, it's not very clear how the refactoring would be done. My 
  suggestion is to specify that the method `deleteChunks` shouldn't just be thrown out but used to call the other methods 
  (`readChunkInfo`, `isBeforeTime`, `writeChunkInfo`, `printMessages`) that would handle smaller tasks as 
  to make the code more readable and maintainable.

# Code Smell 2 - Long Parameter List

**Reviewer -** Guilherme Sim√µes

**Comments -**
This refactoring proposal is a SOLID solution to the Long Parameter List code smell since it adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by keeping the context management within a dedicated class,
and it improves the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) by allowing the method signature to remain unchanged even when adding new parameters.
It simplifies method signatures, improves maintainability, and groups logically related parameters into a cohesive object.
Although it adds a small amount of complexity with the introduction of the `ActionContext` class, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks,
especially in a large and complex system where maintaining clean method signatures is crucial.
This refactoring enhances code quality and aligns well with object-oriented principles like encapsulation and abstraction.
