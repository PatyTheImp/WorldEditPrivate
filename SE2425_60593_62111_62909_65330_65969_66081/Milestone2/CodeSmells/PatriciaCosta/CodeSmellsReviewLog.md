# Code Smell 3 - Long Method

**Reviewer** Nelson Martins

**Comments**

- The code smell is well identified and explained, the method `get` has very lines of code and performs multiple operations.
- The refactoring proposal is the ideal, the regular thing to do to long methods is to break them down into smaller
methods, which is what the author proposes.
- Overall, everything seems right and well explained.
