# Code Metrics Review Log

**Reviewer:** Nelson Martins

**Comments:**

- The **definitions** of the metrics are clear and well explained.
- The **charts** are well-chosen and really help to understand the metrics.
- All the **potential trouble spots** are well identified and explained, as are the classes more problematic,
everything coincides with the charts.
- The relations with code smells seems to be well done, but some of the metrics doesn't have one, I don't know
if it's because some don't have a direct relation, but you did mention some code smells in the potential trouble spots, which is good.
- Overall the document is well done, and the metrics are well explained and justified.
