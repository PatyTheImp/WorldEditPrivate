**Reviewer -** Miguel Flor

**Comments -**
## 1. Abstractness
The potential trouble stops are well explain and analyzed.
The relation with the code smells are well explained and identified what code smells are related to a high `A` value and a low `A` value

## 2. Instability
The `I` metric is well identified, and afferent coupling (`Ca`) and efferent coupling (`Ce`) are well explained as well.
In the potential trouble spots are well identified what a low and high `I` value means. Something to consider adding is that in general the project seems to have a high `I` value.
The code smells are well identified and explained.


## 3. Normalized Distance from Main Sequence
The explanation overall is well explained, the relation with graph seems correct to.
The analyses of the graph is good. When referring to the packages that may have problems, it would be good to include some of that packages.
The relation with the code smells are very detailed and well explained.
