# Code Metrics Review Log

**Reviewer:** Patr√≠cia Costa

**Comments:**

- For every metric, the definition, importance and potential issues seem to be well explained and justified.
- Maybe the data visialization for the metrics **LOC** and **NCSS** would make more sense in a class level or method level. That way, you could identify the classes/methods with extreme values as potential trouble spots. 
- Just stating the numbers and not comparing with expected values doesn't tell much. 
- In the relationship between code smells, you should point specific code smells you identified, and relate them with the metrics.
