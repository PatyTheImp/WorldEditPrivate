# Design Pattern 1 - Template Method Pattern

**Reviewer:** Miguel Flor

**Comments:**

- The photo is not visible, for the photos to work you need to upload them to the repository and use the correct path.
- In the discussion, try to explain better why the chosen code relates with the pattern and not only describing how the code works.

# Design Pattern 2 - Iterator Pattern

**Reviewer:** Patrícia Costa

**Comments:**

- The pattern seems to be well identified.
- Maybe in the discussion, you should identify the `EditSession` as the client class. Also point how that class creates 
  the iterator (in this case, through a for each loop).

# Design Pattern 3 - Abstract Factory Pattern

**Reviewer:** Daniel Agostinho

**Comments:**

- There is a missing "}" `MaskFactory.java`, `AbstractFactory.java` to close the class.
- The images are not visible, you need to upload them to the repository and use the correct path (see colleagues folder for example).
- The packages section's format is very chaotic to read try using "-" at the start of the line, to organize better.
- The classes section is correct, but it's a mess format wise, the fix is putting the "-" at the start of the line.
- The discussion is good, but you should explain better why the pattern is used and how it benefits the code.
