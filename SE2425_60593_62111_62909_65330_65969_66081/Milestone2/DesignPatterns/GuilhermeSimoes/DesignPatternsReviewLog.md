# Design Pattern 2 - Iterator Pattern

**Reviewer:** Patr√≠cia Costa

**Comments:**

- The pattern seems to be well identified.
- Maybe in the discussion, you should identify the `EditSession` as the client class. Also point how that class creates the iterator (in this case, through a for each loop).
