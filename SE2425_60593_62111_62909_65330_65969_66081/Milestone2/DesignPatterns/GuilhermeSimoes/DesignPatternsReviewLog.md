**Comments:**

- The pattern seems to be well identified.
- Maybe in the discussion, you should identify the `EditSession` as the client class. Also point how that class creates the iterator (in this case, through a for each loop).

**Comments:**

- The photos are not visible, for them to work you need to upload them to the repository and use the correct path.
- The discussions of the last two patterns are good, but the first one, try to explain better why the chosen code relates with the pattern and not only describing how the code works.
