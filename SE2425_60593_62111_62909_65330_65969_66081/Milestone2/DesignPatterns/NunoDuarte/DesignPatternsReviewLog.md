# Design Pattern 1 (Template Pattern)
**Reviewer:** Miguel Flor

**Comments:**

- The pattern seems to be well identified.
- The diagram seems to be well-made.
- In the discussion it's only addressed why the pattern is referred, but would be good to explain how this pattern is beneficial to the project.   

# Design Pattern 2 (Adapter Pattern)
**Reviewer:** Nelson Martins

**Comments:**

- There is indeed an adapter for the objects between the WorldEdit
representations and the minecraft's fabric API representations.
- Overall the pattern is well identified and explained.

# Design Pattern 3 (Command Pattern)
**Reviewer:** Guilherme Sim√µes

**Comments:**

- The analysis correctly identifies that this structure primarily uses the Command pattern.
- The identification of `ToolCommand` as the invoker and `Platform`, `Player`, and `World` as receivers is correct, clearly aligning the pattern components with their respective roles.
- Expanding on how the `@Deprecated` annotations and compatibility interfaces fit into the Command pattern would enrich your analysis.
