# Design Pattern 1 - Façade Pattern

**Reviewer -** Guilherme Simões

**Comments**
  - The assessment of the Facade pattern in the `CLIWorldEdit` class is strong, especially in how it addresses its in simplifying interactions with the WorldEdit CLI subsystem. It captures key benefits of the Facade pattern and ties them back to the implementation in `CLIWorldEdit`.
  - By noting that the Facade pattern hides the complexities of multiple subsystems, the assessment effectively conveys how this pattern benefits clients of `CLIWorldEdit`.
  - Overrall the assessment is very well done, but a final, short conclusion summarizing how the Facade pattern makes `CLIWorldEdit` more usable, modular, and maintainable would tie everything together nicely.


# Design Pattern 2 - Singleton

**Reviewer -** Nuno Duarte

**Comments**

The design pattern is well identified but not well implemented as stated in the analysis. Well explained.

# Design Pattern 3 - Proxy Pattern

**Reviewer -** Daniel Agostinho

**Comments**
- The class diagram is well done and has all the necessary information without being too cluttered.
- The discussion is well done and explains the current implementation thoroughly.
- Overall I think no changes are needed in this design pattern.
