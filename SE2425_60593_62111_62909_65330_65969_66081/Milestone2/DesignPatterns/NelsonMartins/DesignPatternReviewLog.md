# Design Pattern 2 - Singleton

**Reviewer -** Nuno Duarte

**Comments**
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
The design pattern is well identified but not well implemented. The inst variable being public is a big code smell.
