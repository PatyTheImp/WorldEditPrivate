# Design Pattern 2 - Singleton

**Reviewer -** Nuno Duarte

**Comments**
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
The design pattern is well identified but not well implemented. The inst variable being public is a big code smell.

# Design Pattern 3 - Proxy Pattern

**Reviewer -** Daniel Agostinho

**Comments**
- The cass diagram is well done and has all the necessary information without being too cluttered.
- The discussion is well done and explains the current implementation thoroughly.
- Overall I think no changes are needed in this design pattern.
