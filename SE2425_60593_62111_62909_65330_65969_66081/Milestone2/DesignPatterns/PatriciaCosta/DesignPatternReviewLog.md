# Design Pattern 1 - Singleton

**Reviewer -** Nuno Duarte

**Comments**
This pattern is well identified.
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

# Design Pattern 2 - Observer Pattern

**Reviewer -** Daniel Agostinho

**Comments**
- The Observer pattern is well identified.
- The class diagram is complete and easy to read and thus easy to understand, the only thing missing is the class fields
  that are present in the code snippets.
- The location on the codebase section is almost perfect but, in each class maybe the fields represented in the code 
  snipped should also be included.
- The discussion is well written and explains the pattern well, without any issues.

# Design Pattern 3 - Strategy Pattern

**Reviewer -** Guilherme Sim√µes

**Comments**
The Strategy pattern in this context is well identified.
It has been effectively noted how `RecursiveVisitor` can dynamically change its behavior by swapping out different `Mask` implementations, making it adaptable and extensible.
