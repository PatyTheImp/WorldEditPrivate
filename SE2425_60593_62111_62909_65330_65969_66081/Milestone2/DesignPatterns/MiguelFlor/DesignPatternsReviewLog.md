# Design Pattern 2 - Iterator Pattern

**Reviewer:** Patr√≠cia Costa

**Comments:**

- The pattern seems to be there, but some elements don't seems to be well identified.
- I can't find the `TransformRegionIterator` class identified in the class diagram. Did you mean the `RegionIterator` located in the `com.sk89q.worldedit.regions.iterator`?
- Maybe would be good to identify the `TransformRegion` as the **collection class** (seems to be a `BlockVector3` collection). Also identify the `Region` interface (which the `TransformRegion` implements) as the **collection interface**.
- Finally, it would be nice to identify a **client** class that utilizes the iterator through the colletion. An example is the `BiomeCommands` class, located in the `com.sk89q.worldedit.command` package, that iterates a `Region` object in the `biomeInfo` method.
