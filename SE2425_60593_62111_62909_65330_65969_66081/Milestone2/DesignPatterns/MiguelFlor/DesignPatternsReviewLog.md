# Design Pattern 1 - Factory Pattern

**Reviewer:** Nuno Duarte

**Comments:**
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. The code resembles the factory pattern because of the 'createProperty' method hides the instantiation logic of various Property subclasses and because of how the method can create multiple types of Property objects (IntegerProperty, BooleanProperty, etc.) based on the provided type. But is not a full factory method because the class doesn't have a sole purpose.

The pattern is well identified but not well implemented. 


# Design Pattern 2 - Iterator Pattern

**Reviewer:** Patr√≠cia Costa

**Comments:**

- The pattern seems to be there, but some elements don't seems to be well identified.
- I can't find the `TransformRegionIterator` class identified in the class diagram. Did you mean the `RegionIterator` located in the `com.sk89q.worldedit.regions.iterator`?
- Maybe would be good to identify the `TransformRegion` as the **collection class** (seems to be a `BlockVector3` collection). Also identify the `Region` interface (which the `TransformRegion` implements) as the **collection interface**.
- Finally, it would be nice to identify a **client** class that utilizes the iterator through the colletion. An example is the `BiomeCommands` class, located in the `com.sk89q.worldedit.command` package, that iterates a `Region` object in the `biomeInfo` method.

# Design Pattern 3 - Decorator Pattern

**Reviewer:** Daniel Agostinho

**Comments:**

- The pattern is well identified, but the class diagram has `methods missing`, namely: `FlatRegionMaskingFilter` and `apply`.
- In the fields and methods section there are `2 typos` in **apply(BloackVector2 position) throws WolrdEditException**,
  namely: BloackVector2 and WolrdEditException should be BlockVector2 and WorldEditException.
- The discussion `should be more detailed`. It would be nice to explain how the pattern is used and
  how it benefits the codebase.
- The discussion has a `random <br> tag` at the end of the text.
