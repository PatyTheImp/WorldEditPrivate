# Design Pattern 1 - Singleton

**Reviewer:** Patr√≠cia Costa

**Comments:**

- The pattern seems to be well identified.
- Maybe you should mention that the default constructor is `protected`, which prevents other objects from using the `new` operator with the **Singleton** class.
- Also, it would be nice to mention the method `getInstance()`, which is how other objects can have access to the `PermissionsResolverManager` instance. 

# Design Pattern 2 - Adapter

**Reviewer:** Miguel Flor

**Comments:**

- The Diagram is not very explicit, you should add the classes that are being adapted.
- The design pattern seems to be well identified, and the discussion is clear.

# Design Pattern 3 - Factory

**Reviewer:** Nelson Martins

**Comments:**

- The diagram is very incomplete, it should have all the classes involved in the factory or at least some of them.
- The discussion is clear and well explained, but again it should mention the classes which are being created by the factory.
- Overall, the pattern is well identified but the diagram could be better.
