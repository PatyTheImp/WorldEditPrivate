# Project Management
## Scrum masters log
MD file with 1 line per week, identifying which student plays the role of scrum master in that week.
Make sure all students get to play the role of scrum master during the project.

## Work breakdown structure
Spreadsheet with the work breakdown structure of your project. This should include a regularly updated list of tasks.
Each page in the spreadsheet should represent the list of tasks valid on a given week, as some tasks might be added 
or removed at any time. The tabs should be named Week 1, {Week 2}, and so on. You can create your own or reuse a template available in spreadsheet applications such as Excel or Google Sheets. You can also use a project management tool, but in that case, you need to upload a PDF with the work breakdown structure, so teachers do not need to install whichever tool you choose.

## Sprints info

Each week should correspond to a sprint. For each sprint, please store the following information:
- BurndownChart (spreadsheet) - chart for this sprint; the spreadsheet should identify the status per day along the week. Hint: you can use the same template (excel spreadsheet) from the SE labs 
- ScrumBoard (spreadsheet/snapshots) - please consider the following status for the scrumboard: *Backlog*, *Todo*, *Doing*, *Reviewing*, *Done*); the tasks should identify who is/was responsible for doing them. You can use snapshots from tools like Trello or Jira, or other project management tools, if you will (as long as the required information is there).
