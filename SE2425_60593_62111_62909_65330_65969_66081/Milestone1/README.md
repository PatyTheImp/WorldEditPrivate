# Milestone 1
## Contents
This folder contains:

- the user stories to extend the features provided by the WorldEdit tool.

Each team member will be responsible for implementing at least one of these user stories. Since
there are three user stories and six team members, this means that, on average, at least two
team members will contribute to each user storyâ€™s implementation.
