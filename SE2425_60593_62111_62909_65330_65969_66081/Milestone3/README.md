# Milestone 3
## User stories implementation

Implement the user stories in the Java code. Be careful not to introduce code smells in the new code. 
The new code should also include the respective unit tests introduced in the classes.

- The updated user stories specifying the new functionalities that were implemented. (updated from milestone 1)
- Use cases (based on the implemented user stories) for the extensions of the WorldEdit tool. The use cases should include a diagram and a textual specification, following the template introduced in the lectures.
- One class diagram for each of the use cases, summarising the implemented or changed classes.
- One sequence diagram illustrating each of the implemented use cases.
- The source code of the running project with the new functionalities plus respective unit tests - this is directly integrated into the code base of the project.
- Tour report should also briefly identify where the implementation was done (including an identification of the commits to the repository)

The work should be fairly distributed among each team member (it can be divided among responsible sub-teams).

## Demo video
The team is to produce a short video with a live demo of their XWiki tool enhancements. The
team is to upload their demo video to YouTube and make it publicly available but not indexed.
The team must also provide a link to the demo video in their report so that professors can see it.

The video can last up to 5 minutes and must show all the new functionalities. During the video,
please add a voice-over where you explain the new functionalities as you show them in your
demo.
