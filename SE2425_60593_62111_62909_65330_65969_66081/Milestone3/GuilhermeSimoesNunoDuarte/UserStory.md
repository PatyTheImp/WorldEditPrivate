## Block Frame User Story

<br> **As an architect,** <br>
<br>**I want** a tool that fills the edges of a cuboid region and optionally fills specific faces,<br>
<br>**so that** I can create structural frames, such as for windows, doors, and decorative trims, while retaining the flexibility to design additional face features as needed.<br>
